# Cookiecutter  Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

## Requirements

- [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html): This can be installed with pip, depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
pip install cookiecutter
```



## Create a new project

In a folder where you want your project generated:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/refresko1/cookiecutter-data-science
```
inside the project folder create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate env
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

install requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
